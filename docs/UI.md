# UI — editor shell & panels

The editor UI is **native Godot `Control` nodes**, built entirely in code from `Source/App/Main.cs`
(`Main.tscn` is just a bare `Node3D` with the script). No `.tscn` UI scenes, no editor-side wiring.

> **Why native, not Avalonia/Estragonia:** this is a viewport-centric tool — the core interactions
> (draw, pick, gizmos, drag a texture onto a 3D object) are tightly coupled to the 3D view. Native
> Control nodes share Godot's input/focus/viewport system, so that coupling is free; an embedded
> Avalonia layer would put the panels on a separate input plane and force manual coordination. The
> one thing native costs us — rich data-bound inspectors — is recovered by generating fields from
> each primitive's `ParamSpec` (planned).

## Layout

```
VSplitContainer  (full rect)
├─ HSplitContainer                         ← top row
│   ├─ SceneTreePanel        (left dock,  Storey ▸ Primitive ▸ Opening)
│   └─ HSplitContainer
│       ├─ ViewportDropContainer  (3D view, expands)
│       └─ InspectorPanel     (right dock, selected object's properties)
└─ TabContainer  (bottom dock, min height 180)
    ├─ PrimitivePalettePanel   "Primitives"  (draw tools, grouped by category)
    └─ TexturePalettePanel     "Textures"    (the texture library — drag sources)
```

`TabContainer` uses each child's `Name` as the tab title.

## The 3D view lives in a SubViewport

So the docked panels can **shrink** the viewport instead of overlapping it, all 3D nodes (grid,
camera, view, gizmos, cursor, picker, tools, lights, environment) are children of a `SubViewport`
inside a `SubViewportContainer` (`Stretch = true`).

Load-bearing details:

- **`Stretch = true`** makes the SubViewport size track the container, which keeps the
  mouse→camera projection correct even though the viewport is offset by the side panels.
- **`RenderTargetUpdateMode = Always`** — the default `WhenVisible` can freeze a live viewport.
- **`OwnWorld3D` is left `false`** → the 3D content renders in the **inherited** main-window
  `World3D`. This matters for raycasting (see drag-drop below).
- **Input forwarding:** `SubViewportContainer` forwards mouse + keyboard into the SubViewport, so
  `EditorCameraRig`/`ToolManager`/`GridCursor` (which use `_UnhandledInput` + `GetViewport()`) work
  unchanged. Picking is a manual raycast from the SubViewport camera (`InstancePicker`), so it's
  consistent with the offset viewport for free.

### Gotcha: a focused `Tree`/`Button` steals tool hotkeys

Godot's `Tree` has incremental type-ahead search, and a focused `Button` grabs Space/Enter — either
would swallow the `F`/`W`/`S` tool hotkeys the instant the user clicks a panel. **Every panel widget
that doesn't need keyboard focus sets `FocusMode = None`** (the scene-tree `Tree`, every palette
`Button`). Mouse clicks still select/activate; the keys keep flowing to `ToolManager`.

## Panels

### SceneTreePanel (left)
The document hierarchy as a clickable `Tree`: **Storey ▸ Primitive ▸ Opening**. Two-way bound to
`EditorContext`: clicking a row calls `Select`/`SelectOpening`/`SetActiveStorey`; the editor's own
selection drives the highlight back. It listens to `EditorContext.Changed` (fires on *every* edit,
incl. each live-drag frame) and **gates a full rebuild on a cheap structural signature** (storey /
instance / opening ids + active storey) — selection-only changes just move the highlight via an
id→`TreeItem` map, so drags don't thrash the tree or reset expand/collapse state. A `_suppressSignal`
flag prevents the programmatic re-selection from echoing back as a user click.

### InspectorPanel (right)
Properties of the selected object. Currently: identity (type + id) + a **Texture** slot
(`TextureDropZone`) showing the current texture and accepting a dropped swatch. Subscribes to
`EditorContext.Changed`. Parameter editing (width/height/… from `ParamSpec`) and per-slot texturing
are the planned next steps.

### PrimitivePalettePanel (bottom tab 1)
Every registered primitive **plus** the two wall openings (door/window), grouped by category
(Structure → Openings → Vertical) as toggle `Button`s in one `ButtonGroup`. Clicking one calls
`ToolManager.ActivateToolById(id)` — the *same* path as the keyboard hotkey. Two-way: `ToolManager`
fires `ActiveToolIdChanged(id|null)` from `SetActive`, the palette mirrors it via
`SetPressedNoSignal` (null = Select tool → all unpressed). Note openings are **not** registry
primitives — they're `OpeningTool` presets, listed by id `"door"`/`"window"` which `ToolManager`
maps to those tools.

### TexturePalettePanel (bottom tab 2)
The texture library: a grid of `TextureSwatch` (drag sources), grouped by source, loaded by
`TextureCatalog.Load()` — the bundled Kenney prototype pack (grouped by color folder) plus any the
user has added (grouped `"custom"`). Drag sources only — no editor state.

**Add your own textures.** An **"Add texture…"** button opens a `FileDialog`
(`Access = Filesystem` so it browses the whole disk, `OpenFiles` for multi-select; png/jpg/jpeg/
webp/bmp/tga). `TextureCatalog.ImportUserTexture` **copies** each chosen file into
`res://Assets/user_textures/` (`DirAccess.CopyAbsolute`) so it gets a stable `res://` path that
save/bake can reference — an external OS path can't be referenced by a `.tscn`/`.tres`. The grid then
repopulates (`Populate()`), and user textures also reappear next session because `Load()` rescans the
folder.

**Why a just-added texture shows immediately — `TextureLoader`.** A PNG copied into the project at
runtime has no imported `.ctex` until the Godot editor reimports it, so `ResourceLoader` can't see it.
`Core/Data/TextureLoader.Load(path)` tries `ResourceLoader` first (imported = mipmaps/compression),
then falls back to `Image.LoadFromFile(ProjectSettings.GlobalizePath(path))` →
`ImageTexture.CreateFromImage`, which reads the raw file directly. Both `TextureSwatch` (the thumbnail)
and `MaterialResolver` (the applied material) route through it, so the swatch *and* the painted
geometry appear the same session, no reimport required. (Cached by path; re-adding a different file
under the same name shows the stale one until restart — minor, two caches to evict for a real fix.)
See `EXPORT.md` for the one bake-time caveat (baking before reimport embeds the texture inline).

## Drag-and-drop: applying textures

A "texture" is a `MaterialEntry` (see `DATA_MODEL.md`). Dropping one **paints every material slot**
of the target instance (whole-object) through an undoable `AssignMaterialCommand` —
`EditorContext.AssignTextureToInstance(id, texturePath)` ensures the library entry then assigns. The
library registration is intentionally **outside** undo (an append-only, id-deduped pool, like
`DefaultMaterials.Seed`); only the slot assignment is undoable.

Two drop targets:

- **InspectorPanel texture slot** — pure Control→Control via `TextureDropZone` (overrides
  `_CanDropData`/`_DropData`). Requires an object to be selected first.
- **The 3D viewport** — drag a swatch straight onto the object.

### Viewport drop — the four gotchas that had to be solved (in order)

Dropping onto a 3D object inside a `SubViewportContainer` is deceptively fiddly. The working
implementation is a transparent **overlay** (`ViewportDropOverlay : Control`, `MouseFilter = Pass`)
that fills the viewport area as a child of `ViewportDropContainer`:

1. **A bare `SubViewportContainer` may never get the drop.** It forwards the drag *into* the
   SubViewport, whose empty GUI swallows it. → Put the drop on a `Pass` overlay on top:
   `Pass` lets ordinary clicks/drags fall through to the container (orbit/draw unaffected) while the
   overlay still answers `_CanDropData`/`_DropData`.
2. **`World3D.DirectSpaceState` is `null` in a GUI callback.** Space queries are only valid during
   physics. → `_DropData` records `(position, texturePath)` and the raycast runs in `_PhysicsProcess`.
3. **`_PhysicsProcess` may not auto-enable on a code-created node.** → call `SetPhysicsProcess(true)`.
4. **The raycast must use the *inherited* world.** Because the SubViewport has `OwnWorld3D = false`,
   the bodies live in the main-window world. `_viewport.World3D` returns the subviewport's own
   **empty** world → every ray misses. Use **`_viewport.FindWorld3D().DirectSpaceState`**. (Everything
   else worked because `InstancePicker` is a `Node3D` and `GetWorld3D()` resolves to `FindWorld3D()`.)

The drop position is overlay-local; it's rescaled by `vp.Size / overlay.Size` for safety (1:1 in
practice). Mask is the body layer (1), same as the picker.

## Selection drag: click-vs-drag

`SelectTool` arms a move/resize `IEditHandle` on press and edits on drag; a plain click selects.
Two safeguards make this robust now that Controls border the viewport:

- **Poll the button, don't trust the release.** Releasing the mouse over a panel lets that panel
  consume the LMB-release, so `OnRelease` never reaches the viewport and the handle would stay armed
  (the object then follows the cursor). `UpdatePreview` checks `Input.IsMouseButtonPressed(Left)`
  first and commits/disarms the moment it's up.
- **6px drag deadzone.** A narrower viewport amplifies click-jitter into whole-cell snaps, so a
  select-click could jump the object. A press must travel >6px (screen space, via
  `InstancePicker.MouseScreen()`) before any handle moves.

## Conventions for new panels

- Build in code in `Main._Ready`; give each panel a `Setup(...)` called after it's in the tree
  (and after `EditorContext`/`ToolManager` exist, for ones that need them).
- React to document/selection changes via `EditorContext.Changed`; **gate** the work — that event
  fires per drag frame. Unsubscribe in `_ExitTree`.
- `FocusMode = None` on widgets that don't need keyboard focus, to protect tool hotkeys.
- Never mutate `*Data` from a panel — go through `EditorContext` → a command (undo/dirty-tracking).
```
